# OnTheMap
An iOS app with a map that shows information posted by other students at Udacity. 

The map contains pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user is able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL. 

The app uses Udacity API for login and Parse API for working with the student data.
